# SignatureWorkPortfolio

There are three projects included in this portfolio. 

#1 There is a personal website I created in my Web Development class (CISC 375) at UST. A personal website is a great way for individuals to showcase their skills, experiences, and interests to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. I enjoyed a lot of making this website, getting used to using foundation and styling a website so it is easy to navigate and format the content you wish to display.

#2 There is a Pipelined Simulator which takes in assembly code and executes the instructions over 6 cycles. At the beginning of each cycle, the cycle state is printed. Once the simulation is done executing the number of commands sucessefully completed, the final number of executed, retired and fetched instructions as well as the number of performed cycles, branches and branch mispredictions is printed.

#3 The third project is a statistical analysis on diabetes and the indicators of being diagnosed with diabetes. There is an exploratory data analysis, exploratory factor analysis and final analysis and conclusion. This was mostly done in RStudio but the final project file is a pdf so it is easier to access and read.

# Reflection

There are very many projects I completed during my time at St. Thomas. Between these three I'm able to show a diverse selection of types of project in terms of what I'm learning. These projects are well constructed so I was able to learn a lot from these projects and they provided both the experience and challenge of completeing the given tasks. Either through working with peers or my professor I learned not only how to complete the tasks at hand but I was able to learn how to better approach problems and finding a well constructed solution.

# Diabetes Analysis

This project started with exploratory data analysis to see if there was data we should cut out due to missing values. We also looked at the distribution and existence of outliers to see if a variable should be transformed or specific outlying observations should be removed. Next we looked at constructing factors. Which variables could be grouped together to create a more meaningful factor and if we are able to construct factors without multicolinearity. If these factors need to be tranformed in any way and how many variables and factors should be used as indicators to predict diabetes. One item of note for this project was that the response variable, if someone has diabetes, is a binary true/fa;se vairable. This provided more unique challenges and opportunities for analysis.
