#Diabetes Analysis

This was my final project for my STAT 360 class. We analyzed a set of data we found regarding diabetes and indicators of developing or having no diabetes, pre-diabetes, or type II diabetes.

Included in the repo is our final analysis file (disbetesSEM) but also our Exploratory Data Analysis file (diabetesEDA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis file (diabetesEFA). 

  For our Exploratory Data Analysis we looked at the data and how many mmissing values there were. If this was acceptable, if we needed more or different data, and if we wanted to drop specific variables due to missing data. We also looked at the mean and median values for each variable, the distributions, and the outliers. 
  
  For the Exploratory Factor Analysis we looked at which variables were good indicators of having diabetes, which is a binary true/false variable. We evaluated if any factors needed transformations or there were multicolinearity issues that needed to be addresed. This is a lot of evaluation of how many variables we should use to predict diabetes because we had around 20 and which ones in which state.
  
  In our final analysis of diabetes and its indicators we made many matricies to analyize how variables loaded onto factors. We did have problems with mulitcolinearity which were addressed in some way but not fully fixed. We had some factors which were not statistically significant predictors of diabetes and at the end our model turned out okay.
