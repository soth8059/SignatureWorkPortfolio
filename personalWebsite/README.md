# Personal Website
This is my personal website. It has 4 main tabs, the home landing page, a resume page, projects page and about me page. This project has a lot to do with using foundation and using a grid. 

1. Main Page
The main page has a picture of me as well as a small decription of where I'm at in my learning and professional career.

2. Resume
My Resume page starts with a picture of the University of St. Thomas logo and immediately following is my resume.

3. Project
My project page lists 3 projects I've worked on. They talk about what the project is for, if it was made for a class or at work and then following is a short desciption of the project itself and anything to note about it. 

4. Hobbies
My hobbies page has a few things I enjoy or find particularily interesting. The first thing listed is my participation in rowing at UST because I really enjoyed this quite a lot despite the people. A video I took on the water is shown on the left. Next I have a picture of a little chick and talk about how I own 4 chickens and find them to be quite enjoyable. Lastly I talk about Ireland because I love Ireland and cannot go into any more detail without rambling for too long.

One thing to note is the navigation menu changes based on what page you are on so there are only ever 3 options shown at once unless you're on a mobile device or have your window simply narrower. In this instance there is a menu button which appears at the top and allows the menu to be hidden when you wish.
